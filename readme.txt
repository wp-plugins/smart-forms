Smart Forms is a very powerful and easy to use Form Build plugin. The form builder lets you create forms by simply dragging and dropping elements. The forms are responsive, they adjust to available space. You can style each form element individually.

You can easily create contact forms, feedback forms, questionnaires, surveys or any other kind of form, from the simple, to the complex.

If you need to display results of operations among fields (e.g. totals) you can do that with Smart Forms calculated fields.
You can easily customize forms to do additional actions after a form is submitted - send a customized email (format it any way you want), show an alert, or redirect to another page. You can quickly view responses in the form’s entries screen.

**Features:**

*   **Responsive Forms**- The forms adjust automatically to available space, making them usable in a pc or phone.
*   **Shortcode Forms**- The forms can be easily added to any post or page using a shortcode.
*   **Forms Entry Screen**- Easily view responses.
*   **Customizable forms emails**- After a form is submitted, send notification email with any information, and in any format that you need.
*   **Calculated forms fields**- Formulas fill fields automatically (up to three fields per formula in the free version)
*   **Custom forms fields**- The plugin currently supports these custom forms elements: name, phone, email, address, number, captcha.
*   **File Uploader (pro)**- Allows you to upload files in a form; you can configure the form to accept only one file or multiple files.
*   **Conditional Logic**- Show and hide fields depending on values in other fields; allows you to have an all-in-one form all in one place, instead of in multiple pages; prevents forms from overwhelming users.
*   **Tons of icons to decorate your form**- Create awesome forms with more than 200 icons; more coming soon.
*   **Style editor**- Change the aspect of your form with the build-in style editor, or if you are a designer create your own css rules easily.
*   **JavaScript editor**_ Create your own JavaScript code and customize your form exactly as you want it.
*   **Forms Compatible with Smart donations**- - You can create paypal forms with this plugin, and also enjoy all the power of smart donations (https://wordpress.org/plugins/smart-donations/, a smart donation license is required).
